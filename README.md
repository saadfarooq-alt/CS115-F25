Hello! 

These are all the scripts I have worked on throughout this term to make all the graders and our lives easier. There are 2 breakthrough projects I have made for this term so far:
  
  1. Automatically setting examples & tests grades for marking.
  2. Putting all the required scripts that are always used into one script that does everything needed for the assignments.

I have made some other scripts that have also directly helped the ISA's in their marking:

  1. Automatic recursion grade deduction.
  2. List of students who have used a certain function which is dissalowed but not caught by our scripts. 
  3. Filter through a very large list of students who have used functions outside of a local scope when it is required to not use (a07 and above)

I will be adding to this list as the term goes forward!
